# NumCode
> A simple ML model that tells you if a number you entered is random or not

## About
Are humans capable of thinking of truly random numbers? I don't think so. I trained a pattern-finding statistical model ('AI') to determine if a number you entered is actually random or you just typed in random digits. Try generating "truly" random numbers using dice, Google or any other semi-random generator and trying those out. Can my model detect when you think of them vs when they're generated?
Go to [the website](https://www.noel-friedrich.de/numcode/) and find out!

**Note**: This model was mostly trained on data entered manually on peoples phones. Do not expect this to work well if you don't type in the numbers quickly using your phone!

## Training
You may help me train this model by entering "random" numbers on the [training website](https://www.noel-friedrich.de/numcode/training/). I would be very thankful!

## Status
This project is currently in development.
